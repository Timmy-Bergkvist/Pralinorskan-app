#### User Stories Testing
<details>

<summary>Click to see User Stories Testing</summary>

User Story 1:
- Any customer have the options to sign up and buy products and save their billing information for future purchases.
  By doing so the customer needs to registrate by using the registration form and provide email, username and password.
  Customers also have the options to buy as a non registered customer.
  
User Story 2:
- On the profile page customer can delete and update their account. By updating their account, the customer must fill out the form and then click on the update button.
  When deleting their account, the customer click the delete button, a pop up will appear and ask the customer if they really want to delete their account.

User Story 3:
- Customer can add products that they want to buy and the cart in the right corner will show the amount for each added item.
  By adding an item, a pop up will be displayed with images of the items that the customer has added and a Proceed to checkout button.

</details>
 
#### Bugs


  - Order number in Order History:
```shell
    When the customer is done with a purchase and is checking out a order number will be provided.
    Somehow the customer will be provided with double order numbers in order history page.

    At the moment I have not located this issue, but I think it has something to do with the connection to heroku and the database sends out duplicate order numbers.
    This will not affect the customers payments. Stripe will only charge the customer once and only sends out one confirmation email.
    <I understand that the the lack of UX is a problem and that the customer will get confused and wonder why there are duplicate order numbers.

    Due to lack of time and the risk of crashing the project, I have not deleted the Heroku application and tried to upload the project again.
    This will be done as soon as possible after the submission.
```


  - Stripe card element in mobile view:
```shell
    When the customer types in the card number, CVC and date the numbers overlap and it looks messy.
    It does not affect the purchase but it looks bad from a users point of view.
    This is an issue from Stripe in the card element.
```

## Heroku deployment

<details>

<summary>Click to see Heroku deployment instructions</summary>

This project is hosted using Heroku.

> Instructions:

  I.  Install Heroku.
```shell
npm install -g heroku
heroku login
cd my-project/
git init
       
Existing Git repository:heroku git:remote -a <app name>
```

  II. Install the necessary requirements.
```shell
pip install dj_database_url
pip install psycopg2-binary
pip install gunicorn
```

  III.  Generate a requirements file and then install from it in another environment.
```shell
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

  IV. Setting up Heroku.
```shell
On the resources tab select:
Heroku Postgres Database
```

  V.  Setting up to connect to Heroku Postgres Database in settings.py.
```shell
Step 1 import dj_database_url

Step 2 Comment out the default configuration.
#DATABASES = {
#  'default': {
#     'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
#      'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
#  }
#}

Step 3  Replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse
        And give it the database URL from Heroku.

DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse('postgres://<your database url>')
      }

Step 4 Migrate.
python manage.py migrate

step 5 Load the categories and products. 
It is important to do them in this order!

1. python manage.py loaddata categories
2. python manage.py loaddata products
3. python manage.py createsuperuser

Step 6 Put back everything as it was.
When everything is migrated and done remove the Heroku database config.
And uncomment the original so it doesn't end up in version control and then set up the databases like this.

if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
          'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL',''))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
          'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
          'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```
    
  VI. Create a Procfile.
```shell
echo web: python app.py > Procfile

web: gunicorn <your application name>.wsgi:application
```

  VII.  Login to Heroku and temporarily disable collectstatic,
        so that Heroku won't try to collect static files on deploy.
```shell
Heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <your app name>
      
```
VIII. Set hostname of our Heroku app in settings.py
```shell
      ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<your app name>', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
      
```

```shell
First you need to install boto and django-storages for this project I needed to install both boto and boto3.

pip install boto
pip install boto3
pip install django-storages

next do a

pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

  VI.  Setup in settings.
```shell
Then add 'storages' to your settings.py file at INSTALLED_APPS

Tell it which bucket it should be communicating with.

if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = '<your-app-name>'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-north-1'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```

  VII.  Setup in Heroku.

|**KEY NAME**|**KEY VALUE**|
| :---: |:---:|
|AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID|your aws access key|
|AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY|your aws secret access key|
|DATABASE_URL|your database url|
|EMAIL_HOST_PASS|your email host password|
|EMAIL_HOST_USER|your email@gmail.com|
|HEROKU_HOSTNAME|your heroku hostname.herokuapp.com|
|SECRET_KEY|your secret key|
|STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY|your stripe public key|
|STRIPE_SECRET_KEY|your stripe secret key|
|STRIPE_WH_SECRET|your stripe webhook key|
|USE_AWS|True|

  VIII.  Custom storages
  
 Use s3 to store our static files whenever someone runs collectstatic.
 And that we want any uploaded product images to go there also.

Create a custom storages file.
```shell
custom_storages.py
```
Next add this function in to it.
```shell
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

Next push it up to github.
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Set up for Amazon Web Services s3"
git push origin master
```

  IX.  Upload images and files.
```shell
Next go to s3 and create a new folder called media.
```
![Image of set up step23](https://timmy-bergkvist.github.io/Pralinorskan-app/media/set-up-step23-img.jpg)

```shell
Inside it, click upload. Add files. And then select all the product images.
